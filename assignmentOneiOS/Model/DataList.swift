Its primary features are that it is high-level, dynamically typed and interpreted. This makes debugging of errors easy and encourages the rapid development of application prototypes, marking itself as the language to code with. Python was developed in 1989 by Guido Van Rossum and emphasizes on the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle and readability.

As it is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). Multiple options are available for transpilation. The default TypeScript Compiler can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript. TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and later, alongside C# and other Microsoft languages.

Object-oriented languages, on the other hand, break out pieces of code into objects that can be created and used as needed. You can reuse these objects in other parts of the program, or even other applications.Yukihiro wanted to create a scripting language that leveraged object-oriented programming and increase code reuse to help speed up development. And so the Ruby programming language was born, using simple language and syntax to handle data and logic to solve problems.

Static typing is a type system that ensures conversions and compatibility while avoiding the issues that come with dynamically typed languages. Go also supports unit tests to run in parallel with written code. In addition, due to Go's modular design, the code can be compiled onto almost any platform.More specifically, Go uses lightweight processes that enable concurrent processing and behave like threads. The syntax will mimic patterns commonly seen in dynamic languages. Golang favors composition interfaces over inheritance.
